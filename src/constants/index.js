    content:
      "Hello, my name is Jacob. I am a passionate individual with a lifelong affinity for art and design. I have come from a family of artists and have spent much of my time drawing and designing over the years. I have been using programs such as Photoshop, ProCreate, Illustrator, and lightroom for as long as 12 years in my spare time creating digital artworks of all kinds. With such an interest in, and experience with digital design and a background in IT, naturally I found web development to be an interesting side of the programming world. As I venture into the realm of web development, I discovere an avenue to merge my creative instincts with technical expertise. From personal studies, to those associated with my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, I have gained a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and backend development utilizing Node.js and Express. Along my academic journey, I have successfully completed notable projects, such as programming a microprocessor-controlled LED strip and leading agile project development for an ecommerce company. Beyond the realm of technology, I find solace in producing music as a personal hobby. With a multidimensional skill set and a dedication to excellence, I am eager to contribute my creativity and technical acumen to crafting engaging and innovative web experiences.",
